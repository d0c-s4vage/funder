#summary Basic documentation for Funder

= Description =

Funder ('''F'''ormat'''UNDER'''stander) is a Ruby library that can be used to define data-formats.  To make use of Funder,
you must make a Ruby class that descends from the Funder class.  I have always used PNG as my guinea pig for this project.
No need to stop now. (In case anybody wants to understand the PNG format better, w3c's specs are pretty good:
http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/, as are libpng's at http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng-1.4.0-manual.pdf)

{{{
require 'funder'

class Png < Funder
end
}}}

Every data format is made up of fields.  To add a field to your class, you must call the field method. The format
for this is:

{{{
	field(name, klass, value=nil, options={})

	name    - a symbol (:name)
	klass   - a class that descends from Field
	value   - the default value
	options - any additional options
}}}
